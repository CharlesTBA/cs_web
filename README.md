# Holy Cross College (Scaffold)

This repository is a professional starter scaffold for a Holy Cross College project with an Express backend and a Vue 3 + Vite frontend.

Quick start (run these in two separate terminals):

Backend
```
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Frontend
```
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Notes
- Backend is a simple REST API with file-backed sample data.
- Frontend uses Vue 3, Vue Router and Pinia (state). Tailwind CSS is prepared but requires `npm install` to build.
- If you want to run everything in one command or dockerize, I can add a script or Dockerfiles.
